# UniLife Housing Project

---

## Introduction
UniLife is a web application developed to provide a platform for university students to manage their academic and social life effectively. The application allows students to keep track of their courses, assignments, deadlines, and also provides features to connect with other students.

## Project Objectives
The objectives of this project are as follows:
- Build a responsive SPA using React: Create a web application that uses React as the main framework. The application should be responsive and should work well on all devices, including desktops, laptops, tablets, and smartphones.
- Implement a routing system for seamless navigation: Create a routing system that allows users to navigate between different pages in the application without reloading the entire page. This can be done using React Router.
- Use dynamic routing and conditional rendering to display relevant data: Use dynamic routing to display different pages depending on the current URL. Use conditional rendering to display different content depending on the current state of the application.
- Manage component state using React hooks: Use React hooks to manage the state of individual components. This will make your code more modular and easier to maintain.
- Retrieve data from an API: Use an API to retrieve data from a remote server. This data can then be used to populate the application with content.
